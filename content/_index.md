This course will start with understanding key resources and terminology used in Azure when deploying vWAN, hubs, VNETs, routing services, and FortiGate NVAs. 
The course continues with the student deploying active/active FortiGate NVAs to secure the vWAN and configuring the the FortiGate NVAs to route and manage network traffic between Company ABC's hosted services located in VNETs.
