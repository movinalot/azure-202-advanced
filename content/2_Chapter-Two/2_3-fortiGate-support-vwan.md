Need to add FGT NVA support info here!!

### FortiGate-VM
By combining stateful inspection with a comprehensive suite of powerful security features, FortiGate next generation firewall technology delivers complete content and network protection. This solution is available for deployment on Microsoft Azure.

In addition to advanced features such as an extreme threat database, vulnerability management, and flow-based inspection, features including application control, firewall, antivirus, IPS, web filter, and VPN work in concert to identify and mitigate the latest complex security threats.

FortiGate-VM for Azure supports active/passive high availability (HA) configuration with FortiGate-native unicast HA synchronization between the primary and secondary nodes. When the FortiGate-VM detects a failure, the passive firewall instance becomes active and uses Azure API calls to configure its interfaces/ports.

FortiGate-VM also supports active/passive HA and active/active HA using Azure load balancer services.
